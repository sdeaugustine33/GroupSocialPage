	Using mysql and Spring MVC I will make a social media page specifically used by groups of people to communicate information amongst themselves.  A user must be registered into the group to be able to view and create posts.  To register into a group, the user must have the group name and group password.  Once in the group, users will be able to make blog style posts or upload files to be shared with everyone in the group.  When a user logs in, they will see the most recent posts of the group.  This would be useful for clubs, sports teams and all groups were information needs to be accessible by all.  The mysql datsbase will contain user information and all of the posts created by group.

The project will be completed in check points.  The checkpoints will be as followed
Checkpoint1: Connecting the project to the database; User login and registration views
Checkpoint2: Implemenet login and allow users to create posts
Checkpoint3: Allow users to be able to upload files (text, pictures)
Final: Allow users to edit and delete posts.
